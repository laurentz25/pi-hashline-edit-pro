Replace lines in a text file using HASH anchors from `read`.

Put all operations on one file in a single `replace` call. Stack every region into the `edits` array, even when they are far apart. Anchors within one call must all come from the same pre-edit read; the runtime applies them atomically against that one snapshot.

How to use:

1. Call `read` to get HASH anchors:
```
read({ path: "src/main.ts" })
// Returns:
// MQXV│const x = 1;
// ZPMQ│const y = 2;
// VRWS│const z = 3;
```

2. Copy the 4-character HASH (before `│`) into `start`/`end`:
```json
{ "path": "src/main.ts", "edits": [
  { "start": "MQXV", "end": "MQXV", "lines": ["const x = 99;"] }
] }
```

Examples:

1. Single line replace:
```json
{ "path": "src/main.ts", "edits": [
  { "start": "MQXV", "end": "MQXV", "lines": ["const x = 1;"] }
] }
```

2. Range replace (3 lines → 3 new lines):
```json
{ "path": "src/main.ts", "edits": [
  { "start": "ZPMQ", "end": "VRWS", "lines": [
    "function greet(name) {",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}`;",
    "}"
  }
] }
```

3. Multiple regions in one call (delete two non-adjacent ranges):
```json
{ "path": "src/server.ts", "edits": [
  { "start": "aB3x", "end": "xY7q", "lines": [] },
  { "start": "MQXV", "end": "ZPMQ", "lines": [] }
] }
```

Rules:
- `start` and `end` are required. A single-line replace is `start=X, end=X`.
- To delete a range, use `lines: []`.
- `start`, `end` are HASH anchors only (e.g. `aB3x`). Do not include `│` or line content.
- `lines` is literal file content. No `HASH│` prefix, no `+`/`-` diff markers.
- Copy anchors from the most recent `read` of the file. Do not guess or construct them.
- All edits in one call must be non-conflicting. The runtime rejects with `[E_EDIT_CONFLICT]` if two ranges overlap.
- If `lines` matches current content, the replace is classified as `noop` (file unchanged).

On success, the response contains an `--- Anchors ---` block with fresh HASH anchors for the changed region. Use those for nearby follow-up replaces instead of re-reading.

Auto-read after write:
- After a successful `write`, the result includes a `--- Auto-read (hashline anchors) ---` block.
- Use those anchors directly for `replace` calls without a separate `read`.

Error recovery:
- `[E_STALE_ANCHOR]` — file changed since last read. The error includes fresh `>>> HASH│content` lines; copy the HASH and retry.
- `[E_BAD_REF]` — malformed HASH. Re-read and try again.
